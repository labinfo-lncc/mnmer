Description: The (m,n)-mer is a statistical feature calculated from conditional frequency distributions obtained from a FASTA file. The resulting table, along with class information, is used to create the classification feature matrix. For more information on this method and its benchmarking results, refer to Andrade et al.'s upcoming publication titled "(m,n)-mer - A Simple Statistical Feature for Sequence Classification".
